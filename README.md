Mapping the number of people who have taken a covid-19 vaccine in Sweden.

This project aims to visualise how many Swedes that have taken the covid-19 vaccine, starting from when vaccines were made available during week 52, 2020. All data comes from [FOHM](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/statistik-over-registrerade-vaccinationer-covid-19/).


The project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Create React App Documenatation](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
